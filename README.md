# wall-app
A quick Ionic/AngularJS wallpaper gallery pulling from Drupal Services

## Demo
A demo is up at http://mobile.buildingthenext.com/

## Status
It works and shouldn't misbehave, but it's pretty light on features. Right now the sources it pulls from are hardcoded and there's only one gallery layout.

## ToDo
- Other gallery layouts such as grid and slideshow
- Detect galleries on server and dynamically generate menu
- Improve image scaling (right now images tend to be slightly larger than the page
- Add more info to the card, such as most common colors
- Add a way to favorite pictures and view them as a slideshow (using ngStorage)
- Switch to ngResource for resource retrieval
- Themes (?)
